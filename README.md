Algorithmic regularization chain implemented in C++

The main file is AR.h, which define two classes: Particle and chain.
The Particle class is an basic class (example) which contain mass, position and velocity of one particle.
The chain class is template class depending the basic class which define particle information. Thus to use it, Particle class is not necessaried if user has their own particle class defination.

The detailed document will be released later.
